# Lead scoring case study

## Description
This project is regarding the X Education (Online education) to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
❖X Education has a high number of leads, but their lead conversion rate is only 
about 30%.
❖X Education is looking to increase the efficiency of their lead conversion 
process by identifying the most promising leads, also known as Hot Leads.
❖The sales team wants to prioritize communication with these potential leads 
instead of reaching out to everyone.
❖Our objective is to help X Education select the most promising leads - those 
with the highest likelihood of converting into paying customers.
❖We will build a model to assign a lead score to each lead, with higher scores 
indicating a higher chance of conversion and lower scores indicating a lower 
chance of conversion.
❖The CEO has set a target lead conversion rate of approximately 80%
